Just as any game, Connect Four requires a board that vizualizes the moves that are being made by both the computer and the player.  For the user interface, we are using java Swing and AWT(Abstract Windowing Toolkit).  In order to create the game board, we are using an array of 42 JButtons formatted to accommodate a board that consists of seven columns and 6 six rows.  These JButtons that represent the game board do not have action listeners; so in the case that a player selects a position on the board, there will be no response to this action. 

Above the board is an additional row of seven JButtons aligned with the existing columns. These buttons are to be used by the player when placing their disks in the desired position.  The user interface has not yet been completed, however, when one of the buttons on the top row are selected or the algorithm makes the next move, the position in which the disk is being added will become occupied.  If the column in which a disk is being placed in is full, there will be a message indicating that that is an invalid move.

Once the player makes their move, the board will be returned in order to provide the minimax and Alpha-beta algorithms a game state to determine the next move that should be made.  This process of allowing the player to place a disk in an appropriate column and returning the state of the game in order for the computer to also place a disk will continue until either there is a winner or every position has been occupied, resulting in a draw.
